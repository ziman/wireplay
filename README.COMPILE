= Howto Compile =

By default Makefile will try to link against libnids-1.23 in the current
directory because of the custom patches (bug fixes) in libnids.

So before you try to compile, go to ./libnids-1.23:
   ./configure --enable-shared --disable-libglib
   make

Then go to wireplay root:
   make

In case compilation fails, try to tickle around with the variables in Makefile
or drop a bug report to AUTHORS

In case wireplay crashes everytime, most probably you are linked against system
libnids, verify:
   ldd ./wireplay
